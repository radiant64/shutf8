# Single Header UTF-8 (shutf8)

A single header, single translation unit ANSI C89 compliant library providing
some basic functionality for working with UTF-8 encoded strings. Building from
source requires no special invocation, and the code is intended to be used
directly as a part of other projects. It is released under a permissive
[MIT license](LICENSE).

## Usage

Copy `shutf8.c` and `shutf8.h` into your project's source folder. Include
`shutf8.h` as you would do for any project header. If you want to keep the
header file in a different folder than the .c file, you need to edit the include
at the top of the latter to reflect this. API documentation is available in the
[docs](docs) folder of the repository, and also
[hosted on GitHub](https://radiant64.github.io/shutf8/).

## Tests

Unit tests are included in the [tests](tests) folder, and a simple makefile is
provided. To build and run the tests:

```
$ cd tests
$ make run_tests
```

## Generating documentation

Documentation is manually generated by running `generate_apidocs.sh`, which
invokes Doxygen and then copies the relevant resulting files into `docs`.
