# Single Header UTF-8 (shutf8)

A single, ANSI C89 compliant header file providing some basic functionality for
working with UTF-8 encoded strings.

## Usage

Include `shutf8.h` in your project. API documentation is available in the 
[docs](docs) folder of the repository, and also
[hosted on GitHub](https://radiant64.github.io/shutf8/).

## Tests

Unit tests are included in the [tests](tests) folder, and a simple makefile is
provided. To build and run the tests:

```
$ cd tests
$ make run_tests
```

## Generating documentation

Documentation is manually generated by running `generate_apidocs.sh`, which
invokes Doxygen and then copies the relevant resulting files into `docs`.
